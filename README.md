# mxr

## Project Description
"mxr" is all about finding recipes based off ingredents that a User has. When a User has partial ingredients to an alcoholic beverage but are not sure what can be made, our site will allow them to input up to 4 ingredents and be given cocktail ideas based off those ingredents. If the User is missing some ingredients they can easily see what is needed based off the recipe provided. Not only does this solve a lonely alchol, but also allows Users to get creative with what they have. As an added bonus for each receipe the User selected they will be given the nutrion facts for healhy concious Users.


## User Story

AS A person in search of great coctail
I WANT a website/application that can show the ingredients of alcoholic beverages 
SO THAT I can access different recipes for cocktail beverages.
IF I don't have the ingredients THEN the application reccomends nearby stores to gather ingredients.


## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN I am using a database to search for cocktails using ingrdients that I have WHEN I type in ingredients THEN
ingredients will become visible on the page WHEN I click the 'x' next to the added ingredients THEN the 
chosen ingredient will depopulate WHEN I select 'mx it!' a web page will open with a a cocktail displaying made with chosen ingredients.
