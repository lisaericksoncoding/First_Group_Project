## Description

"mxr" is all about finding recipes based off ingredents that a User has. When a User has partial ingredients to an alcoholic beverage but are not sure what can be made, our site will allow them to input up to 4 ingredents and be given cocktail ideas based off those ingredents. If the User is missing some ingredients they can easily see what is needed based off the recipe provided. Not only does this solve a lonely alchol, but also allows Users to get creative with what they have. As an added bonus for each receipe the User selected they will be given the nutrion facts for healhy concious Users.
